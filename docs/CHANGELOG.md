# Release 1.0.0

#### Initial private release!

> Welcome to pre-history…
>
> Version 1.0.0 was the subject of my rapid-development process, where I fixed bugs and recompiled constantly without
> effectively keeping records outside of conversations on Discord. Even the changelogs for 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 are difficult
> to put together, as they were also used exclusively for private testing and bug-hunting.
>
> Because of this ever-changing amorphous version, it's near impossible to accurately and effectively keep track of all
> changes, as they were often major, extensive updates.
>
> As such, I won't bother tracking it. At this point the mod was only being used within our private testing servers
> regardless. If you want to view the slew of changes and modifications to this version, feel free to look at the commit
> history.
